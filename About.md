Iris is a fast, simple yet fully featured and very efficient web framework written in [Go](https://golang.org).

Iris provides a beautifully expressive and easy to use foundation for your next website or API.

Iris offers a complete and decent support to its users.

## Our Philosophy

The Iris philosophy is to provide robust tooling for HTTP, making it a great solution for single page applications, web sites, hybrids, or public HTTP APIs. Keep note that, so far, iris is the fastest web framework ever created in terms of real-world performance.

Iris does not force you to use any specific ORM or template engine. With support for the most powerful and fast template engines, you can quickly craft the perfect application.

## Why Yet Another Web Framework?

Go is a great technology stack for building scalable, web-based, back-end systems for web 
applications. 

When you think about building web applications and web APIs, or simply building HTTP servers in Go, does your mind go to the standard net/http package?
Then you have to deal with some common situations like dynamic routing (a.k.a parameterized), security and authentication, real-time communication and many other issues that net/http doesn't solve. 

The net/http package is not complete enough to quickly build well-designed back-end web systems. When you realize this, you might be thinking along these lines:

- Ok, the net/http package doesn't suit me, but there are so many frameworks, which one will work for me?!
- Each one of them tells me that it is the best. I don't know what to do!

### The truth

I did some deep research and benchmarks with [wrk](https://github.com/wg/wrk) and [ab](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/programs/ab.html) in order to choose which framework suits me and my new project. The results, unfortunately, were really disappointing to me.

I started wondering if Golang wasn't as fast for net or http applications as I was reading from different kind of online sources... but right before I leave Golang for good and continue to develop with nodejs and .net core, I whispered to myself:

> Makis, don't lose hope, give at least a chance to Golang. Try to build something totally new without basing it off the "slow" code you saw earlier; learn the secrets of this language and make *others* follow your steps!

These are the words I told myself that day [**13 March 2016**]. 

The same day, later the night, I was reading a book about Greek mythology. I saw an ancient goddess name there and I was immediately inspired to give her name to this new web framework I was already started to design and code - **Iris**.

Some weeks later, Iris was trending on position #1 in Github for **all languages**, this is very rare phenomenon especially for a new personal project, back then,  with such a young developer behind it. After that, as was reasonable, competitors who couldn't handle their losses, and individuals
<!-- with low self-esteem --> began to pull out themselves and their jealousy about the success of others, started to randomly throw defamations and fake news around. Of course they never even thought to argument on the fact that Iris the fastest and greatest in terms of performance and features because numbers never lie and their whole narrative would fall very fast. Instead they tried to bullying me through my personality, they tried to put me down in order to stop the active development of Iris.
<!--  -- But of course they didn't know me well back then, I'm overwhelmingly compassionate and righteous person but softiness does not belong in my characteristics. They think that they deserve the same reputation because they think they work hard too but, sadly, they can't realize a simple fact of life: they don't work hard enough to release a succeed product that people will immediately fall in love, trust and use on their jobs and this is the most important reason behind their hatred for success.-->

However, I strongly believe that we should not respond back with the same coin, instead, I think we should prove them that compassion and love live inside each one of us, by forgiving them and their actions and look forward for a better place to express ourselves without fear and racism.

Nowadays, Iris is more popular than ever. In fact, their posts, unintentionally, made Iris even more popular than it already was and people started to be very supportive to my dream and this is the reason we are still here.
